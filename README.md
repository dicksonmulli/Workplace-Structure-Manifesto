# Workplace Structure Manifesto
This manifesto presents recommendations for a sustainable future for companies that still practice traditional(hierarchical) work structure.

## Principles of Contemporary Organizational Structure
### 1. Be part of the decision making.
As an employee in a contemporary organization, you should be empowered to make decisions and implement changes without direct approval of supervisors. 

### 2. Communicate and give feedback.
Communicate asynchronously while working. Choose the right channel of communication according to the necessity of the task at hand. 
Give honest feedback to each other so that you can work on your weaknesses as well as your potential. Remember, when a member of your team succeeds, the team succeeds too.

### 3. Teams should work on projects together.
Work on projects in a collaborative way and ask for assistance on different areas of expertise, that you are not competent at. On top of that, hangout and spend time together and make sure to do more than just work 

### 4. Take ownership of your work.
Working in a contemporary work environment should give you the freedom to implement your own decisions, make changes and take ownership of your work. 
This freedom will lead to increased productivity and greater work quality.

### 5. Hold each other accountable.
You should hold each other accountable for mistakes or unaccomplished goals, with less or without supervision.

### 6. Teams should determine ways to meet their goals.
Given the requirements, milestones and productivity goals of projects, teams should determine the most efficient way to meet those goals.
