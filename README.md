# Workplace-Structure-Manifesto
This manifesto presents recommendations for a sustainable future for companies that still practice traditional work structure.

## Principles of Contemporary Organizational Structure
Employees are part of the decision making.
Instead of relying on senior management to drive the work process, the contemporary organizational design aims to empower employees to make decisions and implement changes without direct approval of supervisors. 

## Communication and feedback.
A greater level of communication among workers is required, because every employee is dependent on the success of another employee.
Effective feedback contributes to employeeâ€™s development and potential advancement as well as promoting employee loyalty.

## Teams work on projects together.
In a contemporary organizational structure, the rigid top-down model of the traditional structure is removed in favor of teams that work on projects together. 
Under this structure, employees form stronger bonds, because they must rely on each other's expertise and talent to accomplish their goals. 

## Employees take ownership of their work.
Employees have the freedom to implement their own decisions, make changes and take ownership of their work. 
This freedom can lead to increased productivity, greater work quality and a significant uptick in employee satisfaction.

## Employees hold each other accountable.
With less or without supervision, employees should hold each other accountable for mistakes or unaccomplished goals.

## Given the requirements, milestones and productivity goals, teams determine ways to meet these goals.
In this type of structure, employees are given the requirements, milestones and productivity goals of major projects, and must determine the most efficient way to meet those goals.
