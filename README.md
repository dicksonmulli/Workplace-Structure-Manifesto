# Workplace Structure Manifesto
This manifesto presents recommendations for a sustainable future for companies that still practice traditional work structure.

## Principles of Contemporary Organizational Structure
### 1. Employees should be part of the decision making.
The contemporary organizational design aims to empower employees to make decisions and implement changes without direct approval of supervisors. 

### 2. Communication and feedback.
A greater level of communication among workers is required, because every employee is dependent on the success of another employee.
Effective feedback contributes to employeeâ€™s development and potential advancement as well as promoting employee loyalty.

### 3. Teams should work on projects together.
Employees should form stronger bonds, because they must rely on each other's expertise and talent to accomplish their goals. 

### 4. Take ownership of your work.
As an employee, you should have the freedom to implement your own decisions, make changes and take ownership of your work. 
This freedom leads to increased productivity, greater work quality and a significant uptick in employee satisfaction.

### 5. Hold each other accountable.
You should hold each other accountable for mistakes or unaccomplished goals, with less or without supervision.

### 6. Teams determine ways to meet these goals.
Given the requirements, milestones and productivity goals of projects, teams must determine the most efficient way to meet those goals.
